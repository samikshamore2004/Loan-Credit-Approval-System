# Loan & Credit Approval System (Salesforce)

## Overview

The **Loan & Credit Approval System** is a comprehensive Salesforce-based solution designed to manage the entire loan lifecycleâ€”from application to disbursement and repayment. It automates key processes, reduces manual effort, and provides managers with real-time insights to make data-driven lending decisions.

Applicants can submit requests online, after which the system automatically:
- Verifies applicant details
- Checks credit history
- Evaluates eligibility based on predefined loan product rules

Approved applications are routed through a defined **approval workflow**, and the system tracks disbursement schedules, repayments, and associated financial transactions. Managers can access **dashboards and reports** to analyze loan approvals, financial risks, and customer insights.
